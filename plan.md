# Context Condensation Implementation Plan for RA.Aid

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of context condensation for RA.Aid when models reach their token limits. Instead of simply dropping older messages when the context gets too large, we'll implement a system that summarizes older messages to preserve important context while reducing token usage.

## Research Findings

Based on research of various AI models for summarization:

1. **Fast, Cost-Effective Models**:
   - GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI)
   - Claude 3 Haiku (Anthropic)
   - Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google)
   - Mixtral or Llama 3 8B (open-source)

2. **Advanced, Higher-Quality Models**:
   - DeepSeek R1 Reasoning (default for advanced summarization)
   - Claude 3 Opus (Anthropic)
   - GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI)
   - Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google)

3. **Balanced Options**:
   - GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)
   - Claude 3 Sonnet (Anthropic)

## Implementation Components

1. **Configuration System**:
   - Added settings to `config.py` for condensation options
   - Added CLI arguments to enable/disable and configure condensation
   - Created quality presets ("fast", "balanced", "advanced")

2. **Context Condenser Module**:
   - Created `context_condensation.py` with `ContextCondenser` class
   - Implemented async condensation with timeout handling
   - Added fallback to traditional trimming when condensation fails

3. **Integration with Token Limiters**:
   - Updated `anthropic_token_limiter.py` with condensation-aware state modifiers
   - Added async versions of state modifiers that use condensation

4. **Agent Integration**:
   - Updated `ciayn_agent.py` to use context condensation
   - Modified `_trim_chat_history` to use condensation when enabled
   - Added async event loop handling for condensation

5. **Prompt Templates**:
   - Created specialized condensation prompts for different agent types
   - Implemented prompt selection based on conversation context

## Quality Levels

We've implemented three quality levels for condensation:

1. **Fast** (Default: GPT-3.5 Turbo)
   - Optimized for speed and cost
   - Good for basic summarization needs
   - Lowest latency impact

2. **Balanced** (Default: GPT-4o-mini)
   - Good balance of quality and speed
   - Preserves more nuanced context
   - Moderate latency impact

3. **Advanced** (Default: DeepSeek R1)
   - Highest quality summarization
   - Preserves detailed reasoning and context
   - Highest latency impact

## User Configuration

Users can configure context condensation through:

1. **CLI Arguments**:
   ```
   --enable-condensation / --disable-condensation
   --condensation-quality [fast|balanced|advanced]
   --condenser-model MODEL_NAME
   --condenser-provider PROVIDER_NAME
   ```

2. **Config Repository**:
   - `enable_condensation` (boolean)
   - `condensation_quality` (string)
   - `condenser_model` (string)
   - `condenser_provider` (string)

## Implementation Details

### Context Condensation Process

1. When token limit is approached:
   - Check if condensation is enabled
   - If disabled, fall back to traditional trimming
   - If enabled, proceed with condensation

2. Condensation workflow:
   - Group messages into logical conversation chunks
   - Preserve system messages and most recent messages
   - Condense older message chunks using selected model
   - Replace original messages with condensed summaries
   - Verify final token count is within limits

3. Fallback mechanism:
   - If condensation fails or times out, fall back to traditional trimming
   - If condensation still exceeds token limit, trim oldest summaries

### Integration with Existing Code

The implementation integrates with existing code by:

1. Extending the state modifier pattern in `anthropic_token_limiter.py`
2. Adding condensation to `ciayn_agent.py`'s message trimming
3. Preserving backward compatibility with traditional trimming
4. Using the existing config repository system

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test condensation with various message types
   - Test fallback mechanisms
   - Test different quality levels

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test with different models and providers
   - Test with large conversation histories
   - Test performance impact

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with very large messages
   - Test with various token limits
   - Test timeout handling

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Quality Selection**:
   - Automatically select quality level based on conversation complexity
   - Use faster models for simple conversations, advanced for complex ones

2. **Progressive Condensation**:
   - Implement multi-level condensation for very long conversations
   - Condense summaries of summaries for extreme cases

3. **Specialized Condensers**:
   - Create domain-specific condensers for code, research, etc.
   - Train custom models optimized for specific types of content

4. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - Allow users to rate summary quality
   - Use feedback to improve condensation prompts

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust solution for context condensation when token limits are reached. By summarizing older messages rather than dropping them, we preserve important context while managing token usage effectively. The system is configurable, allowing users to balance between speed, cost, and quality based on their specific needs.
